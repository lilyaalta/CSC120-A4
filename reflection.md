Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
 - I don't think I have a full grasp on it yet, I am still unsure when to use it but I think I just need to get used to the idea.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- Going to TA hours was definitely helpful, I went on Monday, Wednesday, and twice on Sudnday for this assignment. I am also definitely getting better at searching questions about coding rather than always asking a TA.
